## Screenshots

The user can search for books via the Google Books API and render them under the Search tab. The user has the option to view a book by clicking on the book's title, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

The Saved page renders all books saved to the Mongo database. Again, the user has the option to view a book by clicking on the book's title, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
